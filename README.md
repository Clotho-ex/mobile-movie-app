# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```env
   # TMDB (The Movie Database) API Configuration
   EXPO_PUBLIC_MOVIE_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here

   # Appwrite Database Configuration
   EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
   EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_appwrite_project_id
   EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
   EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=your_collection_id
   ```

   **Required Setup:**

   - Get your TMDB API key from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
   - Set up an Appwrite project at [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io)
   - Create a database and collection for search tracking
   - Ensure your collection has the following attributes:
     - `searchTerm` (string)
     - `movie_id` (integer)
     - `title` (string)
     - `count` (integer)
     - `poster_url` (string)

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
